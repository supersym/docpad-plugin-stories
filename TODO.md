Todo
----

+ add tables to properly align the several fields, message strings and unicode symbols
+

Some stuff I'd need to work on:
+ better understand node-lazy and node-burritos problem/solution areas;
+ implement a framework to listen on (multiple runs of) rendering done in docpad;
+ map all sorts of these emtted events to our library of structured messages and symbols;
